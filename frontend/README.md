# Music GUI Frontend

This React frontend provides a music composition interface using Tone.js and the WebMIDI API. Run `npm install` then `npm run dev` to start the Vite dev server.

- **WaveformViewer** – displays a waveform with markers.
- **ChordTimeline** – drag-and-drop chord blocks.
- **AccompanimentPanel** – sliders for bass/drums/piano levels.
- **TransportBar** – play/pause/record controls.

The app is designed to connect to the FastAPI backend in this repository for chord suggestions and accompaniment generation.
